libyal is a collection of libraries that are used to access various data
formats, such as the OLE Compound File or NT File System. The original use case
for the libraries is for analyzing data formats or their content for analysis
in the context of digital forensics and incident response (DFIR).

The name libyal was initially a pun on the naming theme of the various library
projects.

The ideabucket project contains a collection of ideas for future libyal
projects.
